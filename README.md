## Integrating Affinidi Products into a Novel Application

In this writeup, I delve into the integration process of Affinidi Login & Vault into a real-world application, as part of the bounty sponsored by Stackup.



### Implementing Affinidi with CMS Fandom Site

#### Quick Introduction to My Idea

After Learning about Affinidi and recognizing its potential in various Web3 applications, I was intrigued and decided to incorporate it into an ongoing personal project, and saw this bounty as a perfect opportunity to do so.

CMS (Call Me Super) Fandom is a site I've been designing some concepts about, now built to a pre-alpha stage, with plans for continuous development. As the name suggests, it serves as a fan site for my upcoming animated series.

The integration of Affinidi seamlessly aligned with my initial vision for the site, and it even inspired me to push further in one particular aspect: **creating an app experience that offers unlimited possibilities for players**. Leveraging Affinidi, I introduced a new set of features that not only enhanced the app's functionality but also made it more intuitive and comprehensive.

## Features Implemented with Affinidi Products

### Multilingual Support

In envisioning a fan site that could be accessible to a global audience, i wanted to test out the integration of multilingual support to ensure inclusivity and user comfort. I opted to support five primary languages/countries from the outset: **Nigeria, Spanish, French, Singapore, and India**.

The choice of languages was to showcase the cool translation capabilities of the app, specifically focusing on Spanish and French for broader accessibility, while Singapore and Indian languages were added for comfortable testing with the Stackup team and Users.

***NB: And Nigeria, to comfortably test with my userData from Affinidi xD.***

Utilizing Affinidi's functionality to determine the user's country, I seamlessly redirected them to the appropriate **country-specific homepage**. Notably, i executed this process without relying on external libraries, resulting in significantly enhanced translation speed.

### Page Translation and Routing for Scenes, UserProfile, Merch Pages

Beyond the implementation of a multilingual application, the core focus was ensuring that each component and its elements are presented in the user's country language. With **dedicated pages tailored for each supported country**, the application seamlessly routes users to key pages, such as scenes, user profiles, merchandise, and a countdown page.

Utilizing the user's country retrieved from Affinidi's vault or (passed & queried)  from the URL parameters, the application dynamically fetches the corresponding translation JSON. Subsequently, it translates the page components, ensuring that each element is shown in the user's native language.


#### Scenes
In the Scenes section, there are three (3) scenes which are translated accordingly, covering titles, durations, and plot summaries. Additionally, navigation links, scene next/prev button and  are also translated, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the page for users.

#### User Profile
Taking inspiration from Stackup's Affinidi Quest examples, I enhanced the PEX Query within the app's Affinidi Project portal to include additional user data such as **profile pictures, gender, and date of birth**. Using these, basic user data is displayed in the user profile section, while seamlessly translating input labels for enhanced understanding.



### Content Age Restriction Feature

Utilizing Affinidi's seamless access to user data, I implemented a straightforward yet effective feature in the CMS Fandom App: **Content Age Restriction**. This feature restricts access to Scene 2 for users under 18 years of age due to the presence of some hard words in the plot and title. xD ðŸ¤”

To test this feature, users can simply adjust their age in Affinidi's Vault, triggering the restriction for those under 18. 
Leveraging Affinidi's capabilities, this feature was effortlessly integrated into a single component within the Scene section of the app.

### Currency and Rate Conversion

On the Merch page, various products are displayed with their ***names, images, age group, preferred gender, and other details***. To enhance user experience, I implemented a feature that automatically **converts the prices of these items into the user's local currency**. Supported currencies include NGN, EUR, SGD, and INR, depending on the user's country (Nigeria, Spain, France, Singapore, and India).

The implementation involved determining the appropriate conversion rate for each supported country and then applying this rate to convert the prices accordingly. If the user's country is not supported, **the default currency is set to USD**.

This intuitive feature enhances the shopping experience for users browsing CMS merchandise.

### Personalized Shopping Experience

Another feature i integrated was a personalized shopping feature into the Merch Page, allowing users to view products tailored specifically to them. This feature utilizes basic user data such as **age group and gender**, which has been collected from the Vault after User Login with Affinidi.

When users opt for personalized shopping, the system **filters all available products and displays a curated selection of up to six items that match their age group** (*child, teen, youth, adult, or senior*) **and gender** (*male, female, or unisex*). 

This customization enhances the shopping experience by presenting users with merch products that align more closely with their preferences.


Here's a refined version of your description:

### Timezone Feature - Countdown Timer

The purpose of this feature is to display the correct release time for the next episode or scene video of CMS on YouTube, **in the user's local timezone**. 

Given that the app already supports multiple languages, it's made sense to show users the release date in their own timezone for better convenience.

Due to the vast number of timezones worldwide, the current implementation focuses on ***supporting timezones closely related*** to the supported countries:

- Nigeria: 'Africa/Lagos'
- Spain: 'Europe/Madrid'
- France: 'Europe/Paris'
- Singapore: 'Asia/Singapore'
- India: 'Asia/Kolkata'

Using JavaScript's Date and Time functions, i calculate the time difference between the supported timezones and GMT(greenwich meridian time). Then determine the ***difference between this adjusted time and the specified release date***. Currently, the release date is a static value but could be dynamically retrieved from a database much later.

Here's a refined version of your sentence:

That concludes an overview of the features of CMS Fandom, all made possible through the seamless integration of Affinidi's Login & Vault functionalities.
